# A-Implementation
In this assignment, I built an artificial intelligence that can solve arbitrary state space traversal problems. Specifically, given a graph of possible states, my AI will find the optimal route from the start state to a goal state.

This AI will be able to solve a wide variety of problems, including finding driving directions, solving a 15 puzzle, and finding word ladders.

The AI is built on an A* Algorithim.
